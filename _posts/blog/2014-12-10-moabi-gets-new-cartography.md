In preparation for the [Global Landscape Forum](http://www.landscapes.org/) in Lima this past weekend, the Moabi team just revamped much of our site cartography.  We were aiming for a slightly simplier, cleaner set of map layers to better highlight our map data.  Check them out on the [maps page]({{site.baseurl}}/data/en) and tell us what you think.  Some Highlights:

## Base Layer

We rebuild the entire base layer with new styles and data.  In addition to the lighter color palette, we added new labels and administrative data, including:

* new admin boundaries for Provinces, Districts, and Territories.
* over 3000 new place names, from cities to villages
* labels for rivers and water bodies

## Era Layers

With the help of [WildlifeWorks](http://www.wildlifeworks.com/index.php), we've added six new layers of data relating to the Era REDD+ project.  This includes data on:

* forest stratification
* project zones
* clan boundaries
* education projects
* community projects
* agriculture projects

## New Iconography

As part of this big push on cartography, we will be swapping in new icons for the hydropower and artisanal logging layers.
