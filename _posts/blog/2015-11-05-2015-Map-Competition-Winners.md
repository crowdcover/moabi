Our 2015 mapping competition has three very worthy winners. All three maps illustrate the conflicts between different land uses in the eastern Congo. .From protect areas and rebel groups to community lands and logging interests, the maps starkly illustrate the contested landscapes, which continue to define resource conflicts in DRC

Moabi runs the map competition once a year to encourage Congolese GIS specialists and cartographers to highlight natural resource issues in the country.

This map raises the question othe role of national parks: Are they solely preserving threatened ecosystems and biodiversity, or are they the preferred refuge of rebel groups?
