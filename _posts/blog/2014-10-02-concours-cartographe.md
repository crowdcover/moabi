If you are Congolese with a passion for cartography, GIS, or remote sensing, then this competition is for you !

Moabi DRC is launching a competition to find the best map makers in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

We are looking for maps that tell a story about the environment in DRC.  Your map or maps can be about wildlife, communities, carbon, conservation or a combination of all of the above.

Maps will be judged on technical merit, and creativity. But above all, we are looking for maps that explain environmental issues in DRC in new, exciting and compelling ways.

We hope this competition will raise awareness about some of the pressing environmental issues facing the people and wildlife of DRC. We also hope it give local map makers an opportunity to show off their cartographic skills !

Depending on your skills, we have two competitions:

* Hand drawn maps
* GIS/Remote sensing maps
