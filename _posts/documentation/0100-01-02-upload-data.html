# Upload Data

Moabi is built as a platform to allow multiple groups to collaborate on vector geodata, all within one database with common, agreed-upon data definitions.  In order for the data to remain structured and usuable, it's important to keep some things in mind:

* All data imported must adhere to Moabi's attribute schema (found in the **[map features documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/map-features/{{page.language}})**).  The schema is built to be flexible and is able to grow as new features require additional data definitions.

* All large-scale imports must take place with an awareness of what already exists within the database.  Otherwise, duplicate and outdated features are likely to decrease dataset quality.

* All imports must clearly document dataset metadata, including source, date, a short dataset description, and if necessary, dataset precision.


## Getting Your Data Moabi Ready

If you have a dataset and would like to upload it to Moabi, there are a few things you should do in order to prepare your data for import.  As an example, this guide provides a step-by-step explanation of how to upload new information on agriculture concessions.  The results, when rendered on the database, will look something like this:

### Join the Conversation

[Get in touch](mailto:info@crowdcover.org) with us.  We are building Data Working Groups around the different datasets we manage.  If others are already working on data that relates to yours, come join the conversation.


### Restructuring Attributes

Convert your dataset's attributes to match [Moabi's attribute schema]({{site.baseurl}}/map-features/{{page.language}}).  This will entail adding some new attributes to each proposed feature, changing the name of some existing attributes, and possibly removing some existing attributes that don't apply.

  * In our example, we look at the attribute table of the dataset using **qGIS** (or any GIS software).  Some of these attributes clearly aren't worth keeping.  Others are going to need to change.

  * Moabi creates it's own unique feature id, so no need to keep the `id` column.  If, however, this were a unique key assigned to each concession by the ministry of agriculture, this would be something we would want to keep track of.  In this case, though, it's clearly relevant only to this specific dataset.

  * There is no need to keep track of geographic data like province or district -- Moabi keeps track of this for us automatically.  So, we can also ignore `Territoire`, `Denominati`, and `Localisati`.  Similarly, Moabi can keep track of area and perimeter on its own, so no need to keep the `AREA` or `PERIMETER` attributes.


Now, to match our attributes to Moabi's agricultural concession attribute schema, we go to the **[Map Features]({{site.baseurl}}/map-features/{{page.language}}/#agriculture)** page.

  * **Standard Attributes** define the feature type, such as hydroelectric dam or logging concession.  Usually, one attribute is sufficient to define the feature type, and that attribute should be the same across all features of that feature type.  In this case, we add `concession = agriculture` to all features in our dataset.

  * **Optional Attributes**, different for each feature type, represent additional information about each feature.  In this case, it looks like the `operator` attribute matches our dataset's `Acquereur` attribute, and the `resource` attribute matches our dataset's `Culture` attribute.

  * It looks like a few of our optional attributes have missing `NULL` values.  That is OK.  In fact, Moabi is a great tool for collaborating on incomplete data, for crowdsourcing verification, and for groundtruthing datasets.

When we are done transforming our dataset, the attribute table should look something like this:

<!-- 3. The last thing to do in order to get your dataset Moabi ready is to validate the geometry  -->
Congratulations!  Your dataset should now be ready to upload.  Simply add it to our public Google Drive folder and it will be added to the upload queue.  If you are having trouble with Google Drive, you can also [email](mailto:info@crowdcover.org) it to us.

### Attribute Rules and Good Practices

In summary, some good things to keep in mind:

* Attribute keys of imported datasets must match exactly with the keys documented in the **[Map Features]({{site.baseurl}}/map-features/{{page.language}})** page.  Attribute values should reflect the values that already exist in the database.

* All attribute keys should be lower case.

* All spaces in attribute keys should be replaced by an underscore: `_`.

* Attribute values that contain multiple values should be separated by a comma and space (`, `).  For instance, if a mining concession extracts multiple minerals, the feature would be tagged with the attribute `**resource**=*Au, Diamant, Fe*`.

* True/false (aka *boolean*) attributes should only be present for features where the attribute is true.  For instance, while an artisanal mine needs to be tagged with an `artisanal=yes` attribute, there is no need for an industrial concession to be tagged with `artisanal=no`.

* if you are unsure about any of these guidlines, or are having trouble preparing your dataset, [Get in touch](mailto:info@crowdcover.org) with us.  We are always willing to help out with the process.
