## Map Navigation

To view data from multiple map layers, go to the [Maps Page]({{site.baseurl}}/data/{{page.language}}).  To explore different maps, choose one or more layers from the sidebar on the right.

To interact with the map, **click and drag** to pan the map.  To zoom in, either click on the **+** zoom button in the top right, **double click** on a region on the map, or hold the **shift-key**, and **click and drag**.  New map layers will be added on top of the existing map layers.  To reorder a map layer, **click and drag** to a new position in the layer order.

The map layer at the top will be interactive by default.  **Hover** over a feature on the map to view overview information on that feature.
