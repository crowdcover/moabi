# How to Use Moabi

Moabi is an open source platform for collaborative land use planning and environmental management in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  For users that wish to edit or analyze the underlying data, there are two different tracks to do so.

* **Editors** interact with the database directly in order to upload, edit, and share geographic data; editor guides are available for [uploading]({{site.baseurl}}/upload-data/{{page.language}}) and [editing]({{site.baseurl}}/upload-data/{{page.language}}) data.

* **Reporters** author short to medium-length reports to discuss and share key insights on environmental and land use planning contained in the maps; reporter guides are available for [authoring reports]({{site.baseurl}}/author-reports/{{page.language}}).

## Map Navigation

To view data from multiple map layers, go to the [Maps Page]({{site.baseurl}}/data/{{page.language}}).  To explore different maps, choose one or more layers from the sidebar on the right.

To interact with the map, **click and drag** to pan the map.  To zoom in, either click on the **+** zoom button in the top right, **double click** on a region on the map, or hold the **shift-key**, and **click and drag**.  New map layers will be added on top of the existing map layers.  To reorder a map layer, **click and drag** to a new position in the layer order.

The map layer at the top will be interactive by default.  **Hover** over a feature on the map to view overview information on that feature.
